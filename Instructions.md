## App Help & Instructions

### App Objective

This app uses a dataset of New York city population projections from 2010 to 2040, for every Borough and every age group from new borns up to 85+ years. This app will filter the dataset acording to the user criteria based on Boroughs, Years of Interest and Population Age Range

### Tabs

This app, uses 3 tabs. The first one is a Table of the Dataset and is updated reactively. The second tab shows a plot. This plot is very dinamyc. The user can select the X Axis (the Y axis always the Populations) the color and even row and column Facets (ggplot). For this data set it maybe too much but it may be useful for other datasets. This is the 3rd Tab and as you can see is a help and instructions guide
